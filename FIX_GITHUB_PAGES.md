# ðŸ”§ Fix GitHub Pages - Make App Live

## Problem
Your GitHub Pages is showing the README instead of your Portfolio Generator app.

## Solution

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Repository Settings

1. Open: https://github.com/zyber-jagan/portfolio-maker
2. Click **Settings** (top menu bar)

### Step 2: Configure Pages Source

1. In left sidebar, click **Pages**
2. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Check Actions Tab

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. If it's not running, make a small change to trigger it:

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger deployment
echo "# Portfolio Generator App" > trigger.txt
git add trigger.txt
git commit -m "Trigger GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

- Wait 2-5 minutes for the workflow to complete
- Look for green checkmark âœ“ in Actions tab
- Your app will be live at: https://zyber-jagan.github.io/portfolio-maker

## Why This Happens

- GitHub Pages defaults to showing README.md when no proper deployment is configured
- Your app needs to be built and deployed via GitHub Actions
- The workflow file exists but needs Pages to be configured correctly

## Alternative: Manual Deploy

If GitHub Actions doesn't work, we can deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the app
npm run export

# The built files will be in /out folder
# You can manually upload these to GitHub Pages
```

## Check Current Status

Visit: https://github.com/zyber-jagan/portfolio-maker/actions

You should see the deployment workflow running after enabling GitHub Actions in Pages settings.

**After following these steps, your Portfolio Generator app will be live!** ðŸŽ‰
