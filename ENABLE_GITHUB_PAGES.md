2. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Trigger the Deployment

Go to the **Actions** tab and you should see:
- A workflow called "Deploy to GitHub Pages" running
- Wait 2-5 minutes for it to complete
- When it shows a green checkmark ✓, it's done!

### Step 4: Access Your Live App

Your Portfolio Generator app will be live at:

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Use GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
- The first deployment takes 2-5 minutes
- After it's live, updates take 1-2 minutes
- Clear browser cache if you see old content

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If Actions tab shows no workflow:**
- Make sure you're on the `main` branch
- Wait a few seconds and refresh
- The workflow file exists and should trigger automatically

**If deployment fails:**
- Check the Actions tab for error messages
- Make sure all files are pushed to GitHub

**After you complete these steps, your Portfolio Generator will be live!** 🎉
